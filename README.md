# 🚀 DSA — Data Structures & Algorithms  

A comprehensive collection of **Data Structure** and **Algorithm** implementations, organized by topic — built and maintained by **[@yamiSukehiro2907](https://github.com/yamiSukehiro2907)**.  
This repository is aimed at helping learners and developers strengthen their DSA concepts through clean, practical examples and interview-style problems.

## 🎯 What This Repository Contains

* Topic-wise folders dedicated to individual data structures or algorithmic paradigms.
* Multiple code examples and common interview problems.
* A separate folder for Go language (`Go/Recursion-1`) demonstrating recursion problems.
* Structured and modular approach for easy understanding.
* Ideal for **DSA practice, interview preparation**, and **concept revision**.

## ✅ Why and How to Use

### 💡 Why

* Learn, practice, and master essential DSA topics step by step.
* Suitable for beginners, students preparing for coding interviews, and developers revising core concepts.
* Helps build strong problem-solving skills and clean coding habits.

### 🧩 How

1. **Pick a topic** folder (e.g., `graph`, `bit_manipulation`, or `linkedlist`).
2. Explore the source files inside — each one contains implementations or problems on that topic.
3. Try to **understand and reimplement** the code on your own.
4. Analyze **time and space complexity** of each approach.
5. Modify, extend, or optimize the code to improve your skills.
6. Optionally, explore the `Go/Recursion-1` folder for recursion exercises written in Go.

## 🔍 Tips for Getting Started

* Begin with fundamental topics like `array` and `stack` before moving to advanced ones like `graph` or `binary_tree`.
* Maintain consistent naming and folder structure when adding your own files.
* Track your progress — mark solved problems and revisit challenging ones later.
* Compare multiple approaches (iterative, recursive, optimized).
* Study patterns like **divide and conquer**, **two-pointer**, **sliding window**, etc.

---

## 🧠 Topics Covered

* **Data Structures**

  * Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, Hash Maps, Heaps

* **Algorithms**

  * Sorting & Searching
